# Introduction
Appspec is a documentation on how to organize and think about software development in general and the teams involved in it. It provides an opinionated view on how the development process should be organized, how the architecture of an application should be layed out and what tools and processes should be put in place. The text aims to be highly on-point so that it can be easily used as as a set of recipes or cheat sheets for various parts of the development process.
